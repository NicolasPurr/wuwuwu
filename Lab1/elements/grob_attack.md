Grob's Attack, or the Grob Opening, is an unconventional chess opening in which White begins with the move:

1. g4
It is widely considered to be one of the worst possible first moves for White. International Master (IM) John Watson writes, "As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move. Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic."
