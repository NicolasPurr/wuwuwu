COBOL is a high-level language. One must understand the way COBOL works. Computers only understand machine code, a binary stream of 0s and 1s. COBOL code must be converted into machine code  using acompiler. Run the program source through a compiler. The compiler first checks for any syntax errors and then converts it into machine language. The compiler creates an output file which is known asload module. This output file contains executable code in the form of 0s and 1s.



During 1950s, when the businesses were growing in the western part of the world, there was a need to automate various processes for ease of operation and this gave birth to a high-level programming language meant for business data processing.



In 1959, COBOL was developed by CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Language).
