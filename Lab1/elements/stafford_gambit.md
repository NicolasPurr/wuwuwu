1. Introduction

The Stafford Gambit is an objectively dubious, but highly venomous opening. A variationof Petrov's Defense, Black sacrifices a pawn on the third move for a quick attack. But is it a sound gambit? Should White accept the gambit to gain an advantage? Or should they decline it?

The Stafford Gambit certainly isn't an objectively good opening.
