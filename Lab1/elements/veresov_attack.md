The Richter窶天eresov Attack (or Veresov Opening) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

1. d4 d5
2. Nc3 Nf6
3. Bg5
It is also often reached by transposition, for example 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Bg5 (the most common move order), 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5 3.Nc3, or 1.Nc3 Nf6 2.d4 d5 3.Bg5.
The opening was named after the German International Master Kurt Richter and later the Soviet master Gavriil Veresov, who played it frequently for over a quarter of a century.
Along with the Trompowsky Attack, Colle System, London System, and Torre Attack, the Richter窶天eresov Attack is one of the more common branches of the Queen's Pawn Game. The Richter窶天eresov Attack looks like the more popular Ruy Lopez opening mirrored on the queenside, but the dynamics of play are quite different.
The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings code for the Richter窶天eresov Attack is D01.
