# Traxler Counter Attack

![Traxler Counter Attack](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/traxler-big.png)



The Traxler counter attack derives from the two knights defense from black after white develops into the Italian game.

After white moves his knight to g5, attacking the weakened f7 square, black counter attacks with Bc5, disregarding his own safety for a lethal attack on whiteâ€™s king side.
