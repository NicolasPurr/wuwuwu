The Réti Opening is a hypermodern chess opening whose "traditional" or "classic method" begins with the moves:

1. Nf3 d5
2. c4
White attacks Black's pawn from the flank, which may occasion 2...dxc4. White may couple this plan with a kingside fianchetto (g3 and Bg2) to create pressure on the light squares in the center.
The opening is named after Czechoslovakian chess player Richard Réti (1889–1929). The opening is in the spirit of the hypermodernism movement that Réti championed, with the center being dominated from the wings rather than by direct occupation. If White fianchettoes both bishops, castles kingside, and refrains from occupying the center with pawns, the result may be described as the Réti System.
In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, the opening is found in codes A04–A09, where it is closely associated with the King's Indian Attack.
