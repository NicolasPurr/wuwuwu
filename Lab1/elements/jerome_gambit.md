# Jerome Gambit

![Jerome Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jerome-gambit.jpg)

The Jerome Gambit is an unsound chess opening which is an offshoot of the Giuoco Piano. It is characterized by the moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Bc5
4. Bxf7+?! Kxf7
5. Nxe5+ Nxe5
White sacrifices two pieces (and eventually regains one) for two pawns in hopes of exposing Black's king and obtaining a mating attack. The line was a brief fad in the late 19th century, but it is almost never seen today.
