The Baltic Defense (also known as the Grau Defense, or the Sahovic Defense) is a chess opening characterized by the  moves:

1. d4 d5
2. c4 Bf5!?
The Baltic is an unusual variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD). In most defenses to the QGD,  Black has difficulties developing his queen bishop. This opening takes a radical approach to the problem by bringing out the queen bishop immediately, but exposes it to the latent threat of e2-e4, for example 3. cxd5 Qxd5? 4. Nc3 Qa5 5. Bd2 followed by 6. e4 hitting the bishop gives White a strong advantage.
The Baltic has not found widespread acceptance among chess masters, but some world-class players have used it including grandmasters Paul Keres and Alexei Shirov.
The ECO code for the Baltic Defense is D06.
