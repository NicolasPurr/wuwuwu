White has chosen the offensive line 4.Ng5 against the Two Knights, but 5...Nxd5?!is risky (5...Na5, the Polerio Defense,[2]is considered better; other Black choices include 5...b5 and 5...Nd4).Bobby Fischerfelt that 6.d4!(theLolli Attack[3]) was incredibly strong, to the point 5...Nxd5 is rarely played.[4]The Fried Liver Attack, however, involves the knight sacrifice 6.Nxf7.
