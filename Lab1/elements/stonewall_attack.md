The Stonewall Attack is a chess opening characterized by White playing pawns to d4 and e3, bishop to d3, knight to d2, and then completing the Stonewall structure by playing pawns to c3 and f4. This set-up is usually achieved by a 1.d4 move order but transposition is also possible via Bird's Opening, 1.f4. The Stonewall Attack is a system; White heads for a very specific pawn formation, rather than trying to memorize long lines of different variations. Black can set up in various ways in response, but MCO-15 gives the following as a main line: 1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Bd3 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4.
