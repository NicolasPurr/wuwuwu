This is a list of chess openings, organised by the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) code classification system. The chess openings are categorised into five broad areas ("A" through "E"), with each of those broken up into one hundred subcategories ("00" through "99"). The openings were published in five volumes of ECO, with volumes labeled "A" through "E".
