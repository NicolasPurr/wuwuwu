Gambit (Remy Étienne LeBeau) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Jim Lee. Drawn by artist Mike Collins, Gambit made his first appearances in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #14 (July 1990) and The Uncanny X-Men #266 (August 1990). Belonging to a subspecies of humans called mutants, Gambit can mentally create, control, and manipulate pure kinetic energy. He is also incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in card throwing, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of a bō. Gambit is known to charge playing cards and other objects with kinetic energy, using them as explosive projectiles.
He was part of the Thieves Guild before becoming a member of the X-Men. Given his history, few X-Men trusted Gambit when he joined the group. There was consistently a source of stress between him and his on-again, off-again love interest and eventual wife Rogue. This was exacerbated when Gambit's connections to villain Mister Sinister were revealed, although some of his team members accept that Gambit honestly seeks redemption. Often portrayed as a "ladies' man", Gambit has shown a more vulnerable side of himself over the years, especially when it comes to Rogue. Gambit is a Cajun from New Orleans; he is fiercely proud of his heritage and speaks both Cajun English and Louisiana French. His solo series consist of X-Men: Gambit, Astonishing X-Men: Gambit, Gambit: King of Thieves, and Gambit: Thick as Thieves, while his team series consist of Gambit & Bishop, Wolverine/Gambit, Deadpool v. Gambit, Rogue & Gambit, and Mr. & Mrs. X.
Gambit made his live-action debut in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, portrayed by Taylor Kitsch. Channing Tatum was attached to star in a  solo Gambit film, which remained in development hell for five years and was cancelled upon the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. Tatum ultimately portrayed the character in the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Deadpool & Wolverine.
